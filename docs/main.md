## Introduction
**Methodus** is a framework for building efficient, developer friendly and scalable Node.js server/server/client applications. It uses TypeScript Decorators to annotate and define the application, allowing developers to focus on the actual functionality, the application features. Its **"Build now, Decide later"** design patterns and architecture is what makes **Methodus** so versatile and powerfull.
